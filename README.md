Man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Sikandar and, wow, what a trip! Like, you ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   and just feel like, “What the heck did I just see?” It’s been one of those nights, seriously. I feel like my brain’s been through a blender. The twists! Didn’t see that coming. It tries so hard, like, so hard to be deep, and sometimes it hits, you know? Other times, it’s like, “Dude, calm down, it's just a  .”

Anyway, the visuals were pretty tight, not gonna lie. The landscapes just popped, and I was like, maybe I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to screencap some of these shots for my desktop. But, then again, the dialog at times, dude, I swear, it’s like they were writing a poem or some epic, and I’m here like, “Just talk like normal people, please.” You ever feel like that, when everyone’s trying to be the next Shakespeare? Gets a bit much.

> And oh my god, the way the characters just, I dunno, act sometimes. It’s like, “Really, that’s your plan? That’s how you wanna go about it?” I mean, come on. But at the end of the day, had a blast with some popcorn and totally blanked on all the logic. Just rolled with it. Makes you appreciate those little things—you know what I mean?

So, I’m telling you, if you’re down for a night of “what just happened” moments, gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . It’s the kinda flick where you’re left on your couch, covered in chip crumbs, contemplating life decisions—not your own, but the characters’. Ridiculous, but in a good way. 

function whatAmIDoingHere() { return “no clue”; }

Oh, and did I mention how it ends? Nah, not spoiling it. But let’s just say, you’ll be scratching your head and hoping for a sequel, even though you know it'll mess with your head even more. Good times, my friend. Good times.
